### Project Overview

 This project is coded in Python Programming language.The main idea of doing this project was to get hands on knowledge in Python intermediate level of programming.The project name is **Spy game** in which i have to decipher the messages from files and then store and print the meaningful message from different files. 


### Learnings from the project

 By doing this project,I have learned operation of Python which are widely used in programming such as :

1.  Using of Control Statements and Loop
2.  File I/0 operation in Python
3.  Raising Exception and Exception Handling in Python
4.  Defining Functions in Python
5.  Lambda Function in Python
6.  Using Comprehension to make a list in Python
7.  Object Oriented Programming in Python

 
 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

   The steps i followed to solve the problem are as follows:

1. Divided the problem into different parts to make it easy to solve
2. Defined a function to read file directly from file path in "r" mode and close the file after the reading a line in file
3. Fused the message by defining fused function to obtain one of the decipher message from the file
4. Substituted an encrypt message into a meaningful word or sentence
5. Comparing the messages and storing that message which are not in another messages
6. Filter the messages which contain only even numbers of letters 
7. Final step is to join all the message decipher from the above steps
