### Project Overview

 Here i have created a **Student Management System** using Python Language.This project has covered all the basics of Python Language i.e DataTypes(Integer,Float,Strings) and Data Structures(List,Tuples & Dictionary) that one should know before going forward to another level of Python Programming. In this project i am using a list of student name to decide to whom we should give the scholarship certificate on the basis of marks obtained in Mathematic Subject. 


### Learnings from the project

 I have learned most of the basics in Python Programming Language after completing this Project.And now i have practical knowledge how i can use Data Type and Data Structure in Python Language


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Step that i have followed to solve the problem is :

1. Created a List of Student in Class
2. Created a dictionary of Marks obtained by Student in class where "Key" was the Subject Name and the "Values" was marks obtained by that student in that   particular Subject
3. Checked the percentage obtained by student in a class
4. Again created a dictionary of Marks obtained by Student in Class where "Key" was Student Name and "Value" was marks obtained by that student in Mathematics Subject
5. Checked for the Student name from dictionary who have highest marks in Mathematics Subject and Saved the name of that student into variable name Topper
6. Then printed the name of topper who is eligible for the scholarship
