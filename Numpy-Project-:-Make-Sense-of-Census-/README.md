### Project Overview

 This is project is coded in Python Programming Language.Here i have use Python Numpy library. The main idea of doing this project was to get hands on knowledge in Python Numpy library.The project overview is that government have collected the data of around 100 people,to find the sense of census from the data and government is trying to check that from the sample population every citizen are following the policy made by them such that the working hours of senior citizen should be minimum.The project name is **Make Sense of Census** here we are finding insights from the data like finding minority classes,minimum and maximum age in population,working hours of senior citizen and finding do higher education get you higher salary and vice versa


### Learnings from the project

 By doing this project,Now i have better grip and practice how to work with Python Numpy.The concept that i have applied in solving problem statement is as follows:

- Array Appending
- Array Slicing
- Array Filtering
- Array Aggregation



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The steps i followed to solve the problem are as follows:

- Divided the problem into different parts to make it easy to solve
- Read the file from the path using numpy
- Get the sense of minimum and maximum age in data using numpy functions
- Used numpy array slicing technique to find different minority class in the data
- Used boolean numpy array slicing technique to filter senior citizen from the data and find the insights
- Used filter technique to find do higher education get you higher salaries and vice versa
