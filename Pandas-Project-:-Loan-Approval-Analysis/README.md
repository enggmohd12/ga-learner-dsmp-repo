### Project Overview

 This is project is coded in Python Programming Language.Here i have use Python Pandas library. The main idea of doing this project was to get hands on knowledge in Python Pandas library.The project overview is that Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Thier loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. To create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments, they have asked for a comprehensive analysis of the data collected so far.

### Learnings from the project

 By doing this project,Now i have better grip and practice how to work with Python Pandas.The concept that i have applied in solving problem statement is as follows:

- Dataframe slicing
- Dataframe aggregation
- Pivot table operations



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The steps i followed to solve the problem are as follows:

- Divided the problem into different parts to make it easy to solve
- Read the data file from path using Pandas builtin function
- Check for any missing values in data and if there is any missing values,fill the mode value of that column using Pandas builtin function
- Used pivot table function to find the loan average on the basis of gender, self employment and married
- Percentage of loan approved based on a person's employment type.
